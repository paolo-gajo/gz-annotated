# Annotation guidelines:

Annotate the recipes (accessible through the URLs in the 'Link' column) listed in the dataset.

In the 'Authentic' column, annotate the recipe with a '1' if you think it can be considered conformant to Italian cuisine; otherwise, insert '0'.

In the 'Traditional' column, annotate the recipe with a '1' if you think it belongs to typical, well-established Italian recipes; otherwise, insert '0'.
