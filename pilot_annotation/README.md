# Authentic regional food judgment

First of all, thank you for accepting to help with this project. We are a group 
of people from Artusi-Raclette institute and your inputs will help to 
understand how people assess and perceive food.

## Your task

We ask you to determine which of the dishes that you are presented with are 
(authentically) regional or not from the point of view of the Italian cuisine.

Please, consider the following **definition** to guide your judgment for each of 
the dishes:

> A regional dish should evoke a sense of belonging to the specific territory 
> in which it was originated. An authentic regional dish has to be  deeply 
> rooted in a region or local population. It must have been prepared over a 
> long period of time with a well defined list of ingredients and through 
> specific and populary well accepted preparation process (recipe).  

### Examples

- A *Carbonara*, prepared with egg yolk, guanciale and pecorino romano 
**is** an authentic regional dish. A *Carbonara* prepared with cream **is 
not** authentic nor regional. 
- A *Pizza Margherita* --with tomato, mozzarella, fresh basil, salt and oil-- 
**is** an authentic regional dish. A pizza with pineapple on top **is 
not**

## Instructions

You will need a spreadsheet program (e.g., MS Excel, LibreOffice calc, Numbers) 
and a web browser to complete the task (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

1. Download the file `FoodDataset_shuffled_4annotation.tsv` and open it with 
your favourite spreadsheet program.

You will see 4 columns: 
- **ID** is a unique id for internal purposes (you can ignore it)
- **Name** is the name of the dish that you are going to judge
- **Link** contains a link to the recipe describing the dish
- **Traditional** is empty. It is here where you have to input your decision

2. For each of the rows in the file, open the link with your favourite web 
browser and analyse the ingredients and the process to prepare the dish. Write 
a **1** in the traditional column if you think the dish is an authentic 
regional dish, according to the definition above; write **0** otherwise.

3. Once this is done, please send the compiled file to artusi@raclette.com

**Suggestion**: do not to this right before/after lunch!

Thanks again!
